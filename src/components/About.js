It broke my heart, not just because she was gone, but because of how much love she carried with her in such a short time.\n\nShe made us smile, she gave us comfort, and now she's a memory I will always hold close. I still get teary just thinking about her.\n\nLuna will always have a special place in my heart and now in my portfolio too.\n\n"Luna, forever in our hearts. üêæ"`

My early memories include playing games on sites like Y8, Y9, Friv, and other offline games on the computer, which helped me develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As I got older and entered my teenage years, I became more involved in multiplayer games like DOTA, Counter-Strike, Kill-On-Sight (KOS), AssaultFire (AF), Crossfire (CF), and various games on Facebook. These games not only expanded my social network but also taught me valuable skills like teamwork, strategy, and communication.'

It helps me focus and get into the zone, especially during late-night study sessions. I love discovering new artists and genres, and I feel like music really helps me express my emotions in ways words sometimes can\'t. It\'s like a personal soundtrack that keeps me going through the ups and downs of university life. There\'s always a song for every moment, and I\'m always looking to find something fresh to add to my playlist.'

But to my surprise, I ended up being the varsity player for our department, BSIT (Information Technology). Since then, basketball has been a constant passion, and I\'ve continued to play, pushing myself to improve. My goal is to achieve even more in the game while staying healthy and enjoying every moment on the court.'

            <p>
              Hi! I'm Archier Pitogo Lacson from Cagayan de Oro City, currently studying at Tagoloan Community College (TCC) where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
              <br /><br />
              I'm passionate about technology and communication, and I enjoy working on programming projects as well as technical writing. I'm also skilled in fast and accurate computer typing, something I take pride in. I believe that having ‚Äúfast hands‚Äù is one of my secret strengths!
              <br /><br />
              What drives me every day is the motivation I get from my family, especially my grandmother, who inspired me to continue my studies and never give up. My journey in IT is just getting started, and I'm eager to keep learning and growing in this field.
              <br /><br />
              In the future, I hope to graduate and gain more experience and skills in programming and tech-related fields.
